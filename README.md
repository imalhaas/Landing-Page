<h1>Pagina Home</h1>
</br>
<p>I used a lot of CSS and best practices to ensure that all parts of the page are responsive to any screen size, including the icons.</p>
</br>
<p>I used a bit of pure JavaScript to implement the mobile menu. I used jQuery to create the testimonial carousel on the page. </p>
